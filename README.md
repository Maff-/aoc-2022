Advent of Code - 2022
=====================

My fourth iteration of '[Advent of Code][AoC]'. The year is [2022].

Because the creator of AoC is still? [a bit sad][phpsadness], I decided to give
the current (8.1) version of [PHP] another try. (I might switch to 8.2 during the
advent, as this will be released on the 8th of December).


Disclaimer
----------

The code you may find here will probably suck. Chosen solutions are whatever
popped into my head first, and only optimized (for execution speed) when really
needed. Easy and fast to code had preference over elegant, robust and easy to maintain.

My work here does not represent what I would create in a professional setting.

You and your eyes are warned!
